# World todos:
	- Draw/process only the tiles and objects that are on-screen.
	- Use the minecraft trick of loading parts of the world before the player reaches them.

# Encounter todos:
	- make sure the player can venture onto places with no tiles without crashing the game
	- if game gets laggy, only roll for monster encounters every few seconds but increase chance of encounter

# combat todos:
	- make it so if a message is too long, it will be split into multiple lines
	- make it so party members will choose a new target at random if the one they were going to attack is dead
	- make running away a special case for executed actions (since it will execute immediately)
	- implement game overs
	- implement lots of monsters (especially the beta beetle)
	
# Items:
	- make weapons
	- make it possible to look at items in pause menu
	- make it possible to use potions
	- make it so armor can have special properties and let armor increase damage, speed, mana, etc.

# Spells:
	- give grass entanglement the ability to stop an enemy from attacking for one turn
	- if we make enemies that drain MP, make it so the spell is cancelled if you can't afford it by the time you cast it
